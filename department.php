							The Department, since its inception in 1951, has been actively engaged in teaching and research in various branches of Mathematical Sciences. It has also been playing a leading role in developing syllabi and curricula for Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes in Mathematics and its applications.
During the fifties, a trend for achieving excellence was set up through the vision and untiring efforts of late Prof. B. R. Seth, the first head of the Department. Under his dynamic leadership, a strong school of Continuum Mechanics came into existence. Research was initially carried out in Elasticity, Plasticity, Rheology, Seismology, Fluid Mechanics, Heat and Mass Transfer, Mathematical Statistics, Psychometry, Geometry, and Relativity out by scientists like late Dr. A. K. Gayen, late Dr. G. Bandyopadhaya, late Dr. D. N. Mitra, late Dr. S. R. Mandan, and Dr. S. D. Nigam. Dr. A. K.Gayen did fundamental research in Statistics and Quality Control and supervised Ph.D. theses of many students including those of late Dr. A. K. Bhattacarya, and Dr. G. P. Bhattacharjee. Late Dr. G. Bandyopadhyay worked in the field of relativity, Astrophysics and Magneto-hydodynamics and supervised the theses of Dr. A. S. Gupta, late Dr. J. R. Rao, and Dr. C. N. Kaul. Dr. D. N. Mitra was a devoted worker in elasticity and plasticity and supervised many Ph.D. scholars like Dr. A. Sanyal. Dr. S. D. Nigam, who first worked in this department and then was transferred to the Department of Naval Architecture, made significant contribution in Fluid Mechanics and supervised many Ph.D. theses of this Department. Besides teaching Mathematics and Statistics to Undergraduate and Postgraduate students of various disciplines, the Department introduced an M.Tech. course in Nonlinear Mechanics to motivate graduate students in science and engineering for pursuing research in theoretical and applied Mechanics. It also initiated research in many new areas of Mathematical sciences including engineering Mechanics. In fact, the first Ph.D. work in this Institute was carried out under the supervision of Prof. B. R. Seth. Established in this Department in 1956, the Indian Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ISTAM), one of the main forums where scientists, engineers, technologists, and mathematicians could interact and exchange ideas, has now achieved international recognition. Prof. B. R. Seth worked in almost all branches of Quantum Mechanics and supervised more than dozen of scholars including Dr. M. K. Jain, late Y. D. Wadhwa, Dr. P. D. S. Verma, Dr. A. C. Srivastava (all of whom became members of the faculty of the department).

During sixties, research programme of the was extended and broadened by taking up research in the areas of Nonlinear Mechanics, Hypoelasticity, Thermoelasticity, Numerical analysis and high-speed computation, Stochastic Processes, Quality control, Game theory, Magnetohydrodynamics, Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic stability, Non-Newtonian fluid flows, Design and analysis of algorithms, and Relativistic Cosmology. In keeping with the then trend in research in Continuum Mechanics, the Department introduced three new post-M.Sc. diploma (DIIT) courses in non-linear Mechanics, Plasticity and Rheology, and Magnetofluid dynamics. A two-year M.Sc. programme and a three-year B.Sc. (Hons.) programme in Mathematics were also started. During this period, Prof. B.R. Seth was elected President of the Mathematics section of Indian Science Congress association. Dr. A. K. Gayen, Professor of Statistics of this Department, played a key role in bringing out a journal entitled Journal of Science and Engineering Research devoted to publication of papers in Mathematics, Mechanics, and Statistics. He was also instrumental in popularizing Statistics and Quality Control through the publication of another journal on Quality Control and Reliability.

In seventies, research was undertaken in the fields of Operations Research, Reliability, Interval Analysis, Compiler Design, and Algebra. It also started giving emphasis on Computing. Even before formal degree programmes were available in computer Science, the Department introduced a new Diploma Course (DIIT) in Computational Mathematics and Computer Programming (CMCP) in late seventies. During this period, Prof. A. K. Gayen was elected President of the Statistics section of the Indian Science Congress Association.

In eighties, research work was undertaken in the fields of Biomechanics, Mathematical modeling, Complex analysis, Functional analysis, Optimization, Physiological fluid dynamics, Dynamical systems, Dusty fluid flows, nonlinear stability of fluid flows, Relativistic Cosmology, Sequential, parallel and distributed algorithms, Genetic algorithm, and Data Base Management systems. A new M.Tech. programme in Computer Science and Data Processing (CSDP) and a 5-Year integrated M.Sc. programme in Mathematics with a provision for lateral entry at the fourth year level were started replacing the DIIT (CMCP) and B.Sc. (Honours) and M.Sc. courses, respectively. The successful students of these new Undergraduate and Postgraduate programmes are getting suitable job offers from various R and D organizations and software companies. Through the vision and untiring efforts of Prof. G. P. Bhattacharjee, the Department also implemented the Cross Migration scheme of the Department of Electronics of the Govt. of India and admitted teachers of various institutions in the M.Tech. (CSDP) programme for three consecutive sessions. Further, it has been continuously involved in initiating research in new areas of development, consolidating research in traditional areas, conducting short-term continuing educati0on programmes for teachers of various engineering colleges, viz., NCERT, QIP, ISTE and building up platforms for interacting with teaching and research communities in India and abroad.

In nineties, the Department diversified its research activities to the fields of applied Functional analysis, Fuzzy and Rough sets, Modern Algebra, Weyl Groups, Fracture Mechanics, Computational fluid dynamics, Convective transport in porous media, Kinetic scheme of Euler solver, Statistical Decision theory and Inference, Queuing Theory, Inventory system, Multi-criteria decision making, Image processing, Remote sensing. Time Series and forecasting, Artificial intelligence, Variational inequality and complementarity problems, Non-smooth Optimization, Combinatorics and Graph theory, Singular boundary value problems, Astrophysics and Relativistic electromagnetic mass models.

In order to cater to the needs of producing computer software professionals with strong foundation in mathematical analysis, logic and discrete mathematical structures, a new 5-Year M.Sc. programme in Mathematics and Computing was started replacing the 5-year Integrated M.Sc. programme in Mathematics (through the relentless effort of Prof. G. P. Bhattacharjee) to train bright students in the field of Computer Science with strong mathematical background. A 2-Year M.Sc. programme in Mathematics was also introduced from the session 1999-2000. This course is designed to train the graduates from various universities and colleges for taking up advance studies in different areas of Pure and Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Operations Research or taking up jobs in government / private organizations.

Prof. S. S. Alam took over as the Head of the Department in 2004. From the academic session 2005-2006, the department started two new programmes, viz., one 5-year Integrated M.Sc. and another 2-year M.Sc., both in Statistics and Informatics, with relentless support and encouragement of Prof. S. K. Dubey, the director of the Institute, who himself is an eminent mathematician. The purpose of these two new courses on Statistics and Informatics is primarily to prepare the students with in-depth knowledge of various branches of Statistics together with applications using modern tools of Informatics and Computer Science. After successful completion of the course, they may be holding positions in various companies dealing with IT, finance, bioinforamtics, medical informatics, research and development organizations, etc. The course is also designed to prepare students for further graduate work at the Ph.D. level, which in turn prepares students for research level careers in Statistics whether in industry, government, or academia.

The Department has its own computer laboratories with powerful workstations and servers with terminals viz., DEC ALPHA 3000/600, HP712, SUN ULTRA, SG02, SG-200 etc. It is also provided with several Pentium machines with multimedia options in the laboratories as well as in the rooms of all faculty members. These systems are connected to the Institute LAN. The Department has a model laboratory in which various geometrical models are kept. It has also a library which can serve the students, research scholars and faculty. NBHM (National Board of Higher Mathematics) supports it by donating few books every year.

The Department has a colloquium which is run by students. Its objective is mainly to have informal mathematical discussions and seminars along with social and cultural activities.

The first Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Mathematics was awarded in 1957 and till to-date the number of Ph.D. theses approved stand at about 360. Six members of the faculty of this Department were awarded the degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) so far. Many of the alumni have the distinction of occupying important positions in various universities, institutes, and research development organizations.

The excellence in research carried out in the Department has been recognized through receipt of several national and international awards. Prof. B.R. Seth received the prestigious Euler medal in 1957 from soviet academy of science for his contributions in the study of Saint-Venant's problem and Transition theory to unify elastic and plastic behaviour of materials.

Prof. A. S. Gupta was honoured with the coveted S. S. Bhatnagar award for his contributions in mathematical sciences in the year 1972. He is also the recipient of the FICCI award for his contributions in mathematical and physical sciences in 1978, P. L. Bhatnagar Memorial Lecture award of Indian Mathematical society in 1995 and Professor Vishnu Vasudeva Narlikar Memorial Lecture award of Indian National Science academy in 2003. Prof. J. C. Misra received the silver Jubilee Research award of IIT Kharagpur as well as Ram Mohan Puraskar in 2004. Dr. K. C. Das and Dr. G. P. Rajasekhar won the Young Scientist award of the Indian National Science Academy. Prof. B. R. Seth, Prof. A. K. Gayen, and Prof. A.S. Gupta were elected Fellow of Indian National science Academy (FNA). Prof. A. S. Gupta, Prof. R. S. Nanda and Prof. J. C. Misra were elected Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences (F.N.A.Sc), India. Prof. J. C. Misra was also elected a Fellow of the Indian National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Mathematics and its applications (U. K.) and Royal Society of Medicine, London. Prof. A. S. Gupta became the Life Fellow of IIT Kharagpur in 2003.

The Department of Mathematics organized the first National Conference "Recent Trends in Mathematics" during January 09-11, 1976 to commemorate the silver jubilee of IIT Kharagpur. A one-day seminar was held on January 10, 1976 in honour of Prof. D. N. Mitra's attaining the age of 60 years. During May 19-21, 1978, a National Conference on "Recent Advances in applied Mathematics and its applications" as held on the occasion of the seventieth birth day of Prof. B. R. Seth. The first International Conference organized by the Department was on "Mathematical Modelling of Nonlinear Systems" held during December 09-11, 1999. In order to celebrate the world Mathematical Year 2000 in a befitting manner, the Department organized on the eve of the Golden Jubilee of IIT Kharagpur several academic programmes, viz., Regional Training Course on "Computer Applications in Mathematics Teaching" for faculty members of colleges and universities of SAARC countries (sponsored by UNESCO) during January 04-18, 2000, two training programmes on Computational Science for advanced level students during May - June, 2000. An International Conference on "Recent Advances in Mathematical Sciences" as well as an International symposium on "New Challenges in Mathematical Sciences for the New Millennium" were held in the Department during December 20-22, 2000.
